<!--
- HTML Semantic tags exist to make it easier to know what content a document contains and how it relates together. Sectioning documents with semantic tags makes it easier to build document outlines that are machine readable.

The ones I find most useful (and have used in most pages I've built since learning about them) are <header>, <nav>, <footer> and <section>. I like <aside>, <main>, and <article>, but they seem like more specific versions of section that don't gain as much from the specificity. That said, I think that has a lot to do with my thinking about these in a way that conflates semantic value with position. Sigh. More thinking and learning to come. Can't wait to see how this evolves.

- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
I'm not entirely sure what this question is asking, but here's my best answer for my best guess: the browser first loads in the semantic structure of an HTML file to figure out how the content relates. That's the step of building the DOM tree. Next it builds the render tree, which maps color and styling to the elements on the page. I say color and styling, but this is really any CSS property that defines how an element looks. After that, a layout tree is built. That governs where on the page element will start showing up. Lastly is the painting the render, which takes all of the information gathered in the previous steps and presents it on the screen.

These steps happen somewhat concurrently.

- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that Sublime is far more powerful than I've given it credit for and that I'll certainly want to spend some time studying up on its keyboard shortcut and command. I'm sure I'll be making more snippets going forward, because they're incredible. The lorem snippet is lovely, and one I expect to replace and augment as I get more comfortable.

- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I don't like building tables with rowspan and colspan attributes. I can do it, but I consistently have to pause to remember that rowspan is a vertical expansion and that colspan
is horizontal. I'll also need to keep practicing which semantic element is a appropriate for a given situation. Both of these will improve as I read and write more code.

# Tackling jQuery

## Key Goals
- Have a basic understanding of jQuery.
- Know a handful of color use cases

## Plan of action (2 hours of study)
### Watch an overview video
*(less than 15 minutes)*
I happened across a really engaging video that gave me a lot of content to work with and modeled several potential uses.

### Look up "best jQuery uses"
*(10 minutes)*
The guides I looked through didn't point me towards too many valuable examples, but I did get a lot from looking at the way Uber built their brand site in this unbelievably productive and short 10 minutes.

### Browse the docs jQuery docs
*(30 minutes)*
Not super helpful actually, much better to get answers, but not useful in the orienting myself process. Probably did not help that the site itself was experiencing hiccups. I do think with APIs and other libraries that offer a QuickStart guide the the docs will be useful, but time will see if that bears out.

### Check MDN
*(15 minutes)*
Pretty sparse. Does contain an additional link to [popular coding patterns](http://shichuan.github.io/javascript-patterns/#jquery-patterns) in jQuery that I appreciate.

I didn't expect it to contain too much, primarily because MDN focuses on vanilla JS and contained some strong documentation about how to avoid additional libraries like jQuery.

I'm going to give videos another shot before acknowledging that I may just be hitting an info fatigue 70 minutes in and need a break/practical component.

Yeah, nah. The Learn jQuery in 15 minutes videos are worlds more exciting at this point.
### Read the top 5 questions on StackOverflow
*(15 minutes)*
I did some of this during the documentation section of time and mostly used this block to continue reading Quora and understand a bit more of the landscape of the jQuery discussion.

### Check the Quora topic
*(15 minutes)*
Definitely useful. There's some noise, but a lot of clearly stated opinions about best practices. (I've never understood why people love Quora until now).

### Look up "best jQuery uses"
*(20 minutes)*
I looked at Uber's site a bit more and dialed it in 15 minutes early because I wasn't learning more.

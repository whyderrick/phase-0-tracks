Explaining to a robot how to use an elevator
(I accidentally lost my previous work with a botched stash so this has a 10-minute time limit for me.)
- Check the current floor.
- Ask owner for destination floor. Store that answer.
- Compare destination floor with current floor.
--  If target floor is > the current floor, press the "Up" button
--  If target floor is < the current floor, press the "Down" button
- Wait until an elevator is available to board. When the an elevator chimes or the light corresponding to it appears
--  Stand 5 feet back from the doors
--  If elevator is unoccupied, board it
--  If there are people on it, wait until there is no moment for 1.5 seconds, then board.

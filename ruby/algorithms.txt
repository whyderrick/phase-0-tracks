Explaining to a robot how to use an elevator
(I accidentally lost my previous work with a botched stash so this has a 10-minute time limit for me.)
- Check the current floor.
- Ask owner for destination floor. Store that answer.
- Compare destination floor with current floor.
--  If target floor is > the current floor, press the "Up" button
--  If target floor is < the current floor, press the "Down" button
- Wait until an elevator is available to board. When the an elevator chimes or the light corresponding to it appears
--  Stand 5 feet back from the doors
--  If elevator is unoccupied, board it
--  If there are people on it, wait until there is no moment for 1.5 seconds, then board.
- Check the left and right sides for elevator buttons. Press the button with a number that matches the stored destination floor.
- Find space to stand by checking the rearmost left corner.
--  If the corner and path to the checked spot are free.
--  If not:
---   Check the space 18 inches away from the nearest horizontal wall. Go there if it's free; Otherwise repeat the search another 18 inches to the right
----    If you reach a horizontal wall, check the space 18 inches forward from the rear wall along the right wall. (go if free). Else, continue searching.
- Whenever the elevator stops, check the current floor (it should be either in an lcd near the top of the elevator or on a small plaque in the upper left or right corner of the doorframe.)
--  If it matches the current floor, exit.
--  If not, keep waiting.
- To exit:
--  Wait 1 second for others to be still.
--  Move to towards the door. If there is a person between you and the door, check 18 inches to either side of the ideal path for a new path. Else, beep to ask for permission to pass.
- If exit is unsuccessful, on the destination floor, press the button for destination floor again.
